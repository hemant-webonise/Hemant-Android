Shared Preference

Create a screen where user will enter his/her name,height and weight.
He can save that data in Shared Preference. If data is already there user should able to see the previously entered data. You need to do this with UI integration.

File Handling:

Create a screen where user can enter the data which he wants to write into file. On the same screen there will be button which will write the data inside file. We will also have button to read the file. On click of that button user should go to next screen and will display file data in TextView.


Additional functionality: Delete File, Stylising the UI.
